# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to the RISK-inspired strategy game.

## 1. Card Award System

**Problem:** The card awarding logic was inconsistent between `game-engine.js` and `combat-system.js`. Both were attempting to award cards in different ways, which could lead to duplicate card awards or missed awards.

**Fix:**
- Standardized on using a single `cardAwarded` flag in the game state
- Modified `game-engine.js` to set the flag when a territory is conquered
- Updated `combat-system.js` to use the same flag instead of its own implementation
- Ensured cards are only awarded at the end of the attack phase

## 2. Territory Ownership Transfer

**Problem:** Different implementations of territory transfer in `game-engine.js` and `combat-system.js` could lead to inconsistent behavior, especially with army management.

**Fix:**
- Updated `combat-system.js` to match the approach used in `game-engine.js`
- Made both implementations handle armies consistently
- Ensured that when a territory is conquered, the correct number of armies move with it

## 3. Duplicate Model Files

**Problem:** The project had both `.js` and `.jsx` versions of some model files, which could lead to confusion and inconsistencies.

**Fix:**
- Added deprecation notices to the `.jsx` files
- Made the `.jsx` files export empty versions to avoid breaking existing imports
- Encouraged the use of the `.js` versions in all future code

## 4. Unit Type Management

**Problem:** The game engine primarily focused on infantry units, while the combat system had more sophisticated unit type handling, leading to inconsistencies.

**Fix:**
- Enhanced `game-engine.js` to properly handle all unit types (infantry, cavalry, artillery)
- Updated casualty application to respect unit type priorities
- Improved army movement during fortification and conquest to handle all unit types
- Maintained the relative power of different unit types (cavalry = 3 infantry, artillery = 5 infantry)

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Code Standardization:**
   - Continue merging duplicate code paths
   - Consider moving combat logic entirely to the combat system

2. **Unit Testing:**
   - Add unit tests for combat resolution
   - Test edge cases in army movement and card awarding

3. **User Experience:**
   - Allow players to choose which unit types to move during fortification
   - Add clearer indications of unit type values and benefits

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update code comments to reflect the enhanced unit type handling
   - Document the card awarding system more clearly
