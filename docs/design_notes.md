# Design Notes

This document captures key design decisions, inspirations, and rationale for our RISK-inspired strategy game.

## Core Design Philosophy

Our game aims to preserve the engaging territory control and strategic decision-making aspects of RISK while introducing modern game mechanics that address some of the classic game's limitations and enhance the overall experience.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Variable Map Layouts
**Rationale:** The fixed RISK map can become predictable for experienced players. Variable maps will increase replayability and require players to adapt their strategies.

**Implementation:**
- Procedurally generated maps based on parameters
- Multiple pre-designed maps focusing on different regions or historical periods
- Map editor for custom scenarios

### 2. Unit Types
**Rationale:** The single unit type in RISK limits strategic depth. Different unit types will create more meaningful choices and tactical variety.

**Implementation:**
- Infantry: Basic units, cheap but less powerful
- Cavalry: Mobile units that can move further during fortification
- Artillery: Powerful units with bonuses when defending
- Naval Units: Control sea routes and enable different attack paths
- Special Units: Unique units with specific abilities (e.g., spies, medics)

### 3. Tech Tree
**Rationale:** Adding progression throughout the game keeps players engaged and provides more strategic paths.

**Implementation:**
- Research points gained by controlling territories with research centers
- Military technologies that improve combat capabilities
- Economic technologies that enhance resource generation
- Diplomatic technologies that improve alliance benefits
- Each technology branch offers different strategic advantages

### 4. Dynamic Events
**Rationale:** Random events add unpredictability and create memorable moments while reducing the deterministic nature of the game.

**Implementation:**
- Global events affecting all players (natural disasters, plagues)
- Territory-specific events (rebellions, resource discoveries)
- Player-triggered events through special actions
- Event cards that can be played strategically

### 5. Multiple Victory Conditions
**Rationale:** Total world domination can make games lengthy and lead to player elimination. Alternative victory conditions keep more players engaged throughout.

**Implementation:**
- Military Victory: Traditional control of all territories
- Economic Victory: Control key resource territories for a number of turns
- Diplomatic Victory: Form alliances with a majority of remaining players
- Technology Victory: Complete a specific research path
- Objective Victory: Complete secret or public objectives

### 6. Alliance System
**Rationale:** Formalized alliances add a diplomatic layer to the game and create interesting dynamics beyond pure military competition.

**Implementation:**
- Non-aggression pacts between players
- Resource sharing between allies
- Joint attacks against common enemies
- Alliance benefits that grow over time
- Betrayal mechanics with costs and benefits

### 7. Resource Management
**Rationale:** Adding resources beyond just armies creates more strategic depth and territory valuation beyond continent bonuses.

**Implementation:**
- Multiple resource types (food, production, research, wealth)
- Territories produce different resources
- Resources used for recruiting units, researching technologies, and special actions
- Supply lines that can be disrupted by enemies

## Balancing Considerations

- Ensuring no single strategy dominates gameplay
- Balanced distribution of resources and strategic locations on maps
- Catch-up mechanics to keep eliminated or weakened players engaged
- Scaling difficulty for AI opponents
- Turn time limits to maintain game pace

## Player Experience Goals

- Accessible to new players while offering depth for veterans
- Reduced downtime between meaningful decisions
- Clear feedback on the game state and available options
- Emotional highs through risk-taking and strategic planning
- Social interaction through alliances and diplomacy
- 60-120 minute average game length

## Technical Implementation Priorities

1. Core territory and unit management systems
2. Combat resolution mechanics
3. Turn structure and phases
4. Alliance and diplomacy systems
5. Resource and technology management
6. User interface and map visualization
7. AI opponents and behavior patterns
8. Multiplayer functionality
