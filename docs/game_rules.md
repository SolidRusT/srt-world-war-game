# Game Rules and Mechanics

This document outlines the core rules and mechanics for our RISK-inspired strategy game.

## Game Overview

A turn-based strategy game of global conquest where players compete to control territories and eventually the entire world map. Victory is achieved by eliminating all opposing players or completing specific objectives.

## Game Components

- **Game Board**: A world map divided into territories across multiple continents
- **Armies**: Units that players use to occupy and defend territories
- **Cards**: Territory cards that can be traded for additional armies
- **Dice**: Used to resolve combat between opposing armies

## Game Setup

1. Each player selects a color and receives an initial allocation of armies based on the number of players:
   - 3 players: 35 armies each
   - 4 players: 30 armies each
   - 5 players: 25 armies each

2. Players take turns placing one army on an unoccupied territory until all territories are claimed.

3. Players continue taking turns placing their remaining armies on their territories.

4. The player who placed the first army begins the game.

## Turn Structure

Each player's turn consists of three phases:

1. **Reinforcement Phase**: Receive and place new armies
2. **Attack Phase**: Launch attacks against adjacent enemy territories (optional)
3. **Fortification Phase**: Move armies between connected friendly territories (optional)

## Reinforcement Phase

Players receive new armies at the beginning of their turn based on:

1. **Territories Controlled**: 1 army for every 3 territories (minimum of 3)
2. **Continent Bonuses**: Additional armies for controlling entire continents
   - North America: 5 armies
   - South America: 2 armies
   - Europe: 5 armies
   - Africa: 3 armies
   - Asia: 7 armies
   - Australia: 2 armies
3. **Card Sets**: Armies for trading in matching sets of cards (increasing value)

## Attack Phase

1. Players may attack any adjacent enemy territory from their own territory.
2. The attacking territory must have at least 2 armies.
3. Combat is resolved using dice:
   - Attacker rolls up to 3 dice (must have more armies than dice rolled)
   - Defender rolls up to 2 dice (must have at least as many armies as dice rolled)
   - Highest dice are compared: higher value wins, defender wins ties
   - Loser removes one army for each die comparison lost
4. If all defending armies are eliminated, the attacker moves at least the number of dice rolled into the conquered territory.
5. A player who conquers at least one territory during their turn draws one Territory Card.

## Fortification Phase

1. At the end of their turn, a player may move any number of armies from one of their territories to an adjacent friendly territory.
2. This movement can only occur once per turn.

## Territory Cards

1. Players earn one card after conquering at least one territory on their turn.
2. Cards can be traded in for additional armies during the Reinforcement Phase.
3. Sets consist of:
   - Three cards of the same type (Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery)
   - One of each type
   - Any two cards plus a Wild card
4. The number of armies received increases with each set traded in.
5. If a player controls a territory shown on a traded card, they receive 2 additional armies that must be placed on that territory.

## Game End

The game ends when one player has eliminated all opponents by capturing all territories on the board.
